// Wrappers to make logging cleaner.

// Note that for now I've left the definitions of LogFile and LogDebug as they
// were - either declared locally in a file, as an extern, or from another
// namespace altogether. At some point this needs to be cleaned up, but it's
// probably not worth doing so unless we were switching to use a central
// logging framework.
