; Custom settings override for any of [convergence, separation, x, y, z, w]
;
; Four types are supported - by default the bindings will simply load the
; configured settings, but type=hold can be specified to have a preset
; active while the button is held, type=toggle can be used to make a simple
; on/off toggle, and type=cycle can be used to cycle between several presets.
;
; Delays (type=hold only) and linear or cosine trasition periods (any key type)
; can be used to better synchonrise setting changes to the game's animations,
; or to smoothly adjust UI elements over a short period of time.
;
; Key bindings: For A-Z and 0-9 on the number row, just use that single
; character. For everything else (including mouse buttons), use the virtual key
; name (with or without the VK_ prefix) or hex code from this article:
; http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx
;
; Key combinations can be specified by separating key names with spaces, e.g.
; "Shift Q". It is also possible to indicate that a key must *not* be held for
; the binding to activate, e.g. "NO_ALT F1" would prevent the binding from
; activating when taking a 3D Screenshot with Alt F1. "NO_MODIFIERS" may be
; used as a shorthand for excluding all standard modifiers (Ctrl, Alt, Shift,
; Windows).
;
; Keys can also be from XBox controllers using:
;   XB_LEFT_TRIGGER, XB_RIGHT_TRIGGER,
;   XB_LEFT_SHOULDER, XB_RIGHT_SHOULDER,
;   XB_LEFT_THUMB, XB_RIGHT_THUMB,
;   XB_DPAD_UP, XB_DPAD_DOWN, XB_DPAD_LEFT, XB_DPAD_RIGHT,
;   XB_A, XB_B, XB_X, XB_Y, XB_START, XB_BACK, XB_GUIDE
; By default all attached controllers are used - to associate a binding with a
; specific controller add the controller number 1-4 to the prefix, like
; XB2_LEFT_TRIGGER, though this may be more useful for hunting than playing.

;                 changes (one log file per context)
;           hold: Continue analysing subsequent frames while the key is held
;    dump_rt_jps: Dumps out render targets as JPS files. These are the easiest to
;                 work with and don't take up as much space as DDS files, but they
;                 are not dumped for every render target and are missing some data.
;    dump_rt_dds: Dumps out render targets as DDS files. WARNING: This option may
;                 require hundreds of gigabytes and a long time! Only use it if
;                 you absolutely need more information than you can get otherwise.
;                 Will also dump buffer type render targets & UAVs as .buf files.
;        dump_rt: Dumps render targets as JPS files when possible, or DDS when not.
;       clear_rt: Clears each render target the first time they are used in the
;                 frame. Makes it easier to see what is being drawn if the game
;                 doesn't clear them, but might cause some effects not to render.
;     dump_depth: Dumps depth/stencil targets as DDS files
;   dump_tex_jps: Dumps textures as JPS files
;   dump_tex_dds: Dumps textures as DDS files (Same warning as for dump_rt_dds)
;                 Will also dump buffer type shader resource views as .buf files.
;       dump_tex: Dumps textures as JPS files when possible, or DDS when not.
;        dump_cb: Dumps constant buffers as binary .buf files
;    dump_cb_txt: Decodes constant buffers as an array of float4s
;        dump_vb: Dumps vertex buffers as binary .buf files
;    dump_vb_txt: Decodes vertex buffers as an array of float4s
;        dump_ib: Dumps index buffers as binary .buf files
;    dump_ib_txt: Decodes index buffers
;   dump_buf_bin: Dumps buffers as binary .buf files
;   dump_buf_txt: Decodes buffers as an array of float4s
;      dump_desc: Dump .dsc files next to each resource with their descriptions
;   filename_reg: Normally the draw number is the first part of the filename so
;                 that the files will be sorted in the order they were used in
;                 the game. Sometimes it is more desirable to examine how a
;                 specific output changed through the frame and this option will
;                 place the register number first in the filename to allow that.
;           mono: Dump out mono textures instead of stereo. To dump both, specify
;                 'mono stereo'. If neither are specified, defaults to stereo.
;  dump_on_unmap: Dumps buffers/textures whenever the game maps them to the CPU
;                 with the Map() / Unmap() calls. Typically used to update
;                 constant buffers.
; dump_on_update: Dumps buffers/textures whenever the game updates them with
;                 the UpdateSubresource() call. Alternative method used to
;                 update constant buffers.
;   deferred_ctx: Enable experimental support for dumping from deferred
;                 contexts into subdirectories inside the frame analysis
;                 directory. Note that this will dump the resources *before*
;                 they are updated on the GPU, so only recommended to dump
;                 resources that are only updated by the CPU, such as dump_cb,
;                 dump_vb, dump_ib and (to a limited extent) dump_tex.
;                 dump_rt and dump_depth will be useless, and textures that
;                 have been updated on the GPU will be outdated. Recommended
;                 to use in conjunction with 'mono', as there are some
;                 theoretical issues with dumping stereo resources from
;                 deferred contexts. Theoretically may cause crashes.
;  share_deduped: Use a folder that is shared with subsequent frame analysis
;                 dumps for deduplicating dumped resources. Makes future frame
;                 analysis dumps faster and use less disk space if there are a
;                 lot of identical textures, but less trivial to delete
;                 individual dump folders to reclaim disk space (i.e. all or
;                 nothing).
;
; analyse_options can also be specified in [ShaderOverride*] sections (or other
; command lists) to set up triggers to change the options mid-way through a
; frame analysis, either for a single draw call (default), or permanently (by
; adding the 'persist' keyword).
;
; Alternatively, "dump" can be specified in a [ShaderOverride*] section (or
; any other command list) to dump specific resources (e.g. "dump = dump_tex_dds
; share_deduped mono ps-t0"), dump resources at a specific point in time (e.g.
; "pre dump = o0") or dump a custom resource that frame analysis cannot
; otherwise see (e.g. "dump = ResourceDepthBuffer").

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; On the fly regular expression shader patching engine
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; These sections define regular expressions to match against shaders and apply
; certain classes of fixes on the fly. Only assembly shaders are supported by
; this method for reliability and performance reasons.
;
; Every pattern must have a main section prefixed with ShaderRegex:
;
;[ShaderRegex1]
; shader_model is required and must be set to the types of shaders that this
; pattern will be applied against. Multiple shader models can be specified to
; match the pattern against multiple types. There are some differences in
; instructions between shader model 4 and 5 (such as in resource load
; instructions), so in some cases you may need separate patterns for each.
;shader_model = ps_4_0 ps_5_0
;
; temps is used to give names to temporary registers that you will use in the
; pattern. 3DMigoto will identify free register numbers and automatically
; adjust dcl_temps as required.
;temps = stereo tmp1
;
; This main section also acts as a command list so that you can define actions
; that will be applied on every matching shader, just as you would on any other
; command list enabled section, such as ShaderOverride, Present, etc.
;
;
; The next section of interest is the regular expression pattern. If this
; section is omitted than every shader of with matching shader_model will be
; matched (and have the command lists and InsertDeclarations processed). The
; first part of the section name must match the main ShaderRegex section you
; defined above, and it ends with ".Pattern". The regular expression grammar
; that we support is PCRE2, which is largely compatible with the powerful Perl
; and Python grammars. You can find the syntax reference here, but generally
; speaking any regular expression tutorial will give you a good primer:
;
;   http://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2syntax.html
;
; Note that since this is parsed in an ini file that blank lines and ini
; comments are ignored, and preceding and trailing whitespace from each line
; will be stripped, so if you need to match an indented line you will need to
; explicitly match the whitespace at the start of the line with \s*
; You should also use \n to match the newline character at the end of each
; line. This should not be confused with extended mode activated by the (?x)
; switch, which will ignore *all* whitespace to allow complex patterns to be
; broken up for clarity.
;
; Multiline matching is enabled by default, as is case insensitivity (due to
; differences in the capitalisation produced by different versions of the
; disassembler), but PCRE2 provides switches for most of these options if you
; need something else.
;
; This is an example of how you might match a matrix multiply in a shader, and
; uses Python style named capture groups to pull out the registers and swizzles
; of the X and Z coordinates, and another named capture group to verify that
; the register used in the div instruction matches the one used in the multiply:
;
;[ShaderRegex1.Pattern]
;mul r\d+\.xyzw, r\d+\.yyyy, cb0\[28\]\.xyzw\n
;mad r\d+\.xyzw, (?P<pos_x>r\d+)\.(?P<swizzle_x>[xyzw])[xyzw]{3}, cb0\[27\]\.xyzw, r\d+\.xyzw\n
;mad r\d+\.xyzw, (?P<pos_z>r\d+)\.(?P<swizzle_z>[xyzw])[xyzw]{3}, cb0\[29\]\.xyzw, r\d+\.xyzw\n
;add (?P<result>r\d+)\.xyzw, r\d+\.xyzw, cb0\[30\]\.xyzw\n
;div r\d+\.[xyzw]{2}, (?P=result)\.[xyzw]{4}, r\d+\.wwww\n
;
;
; The next section specifies how to modify the matched pattern. Again the name
; must begin with the same name as the main section, and end in
; ".Pattern.Replace" (there is a reason the replacement is associated with the
; pattern, but that's coming soon). You can (and I highly encourage that you
; do) use named capture groups in the above pattern and substitute them in
; here. Temporary registers that you defined in the main ShaderRegex section
; are also available here with the same syntax as named capture groups. Use
; ${0} to indicate where the matched pattern goes, allowing you to insert code
; before and/or after it, or use additonal capture groups to insert code in the
; middle. Extended substitution is enabled in PCRE2, which among other things
; makes \n insert a newline.
;
;[ShaderRegex1.Pattern.Replace]
;\n
;// UE4 shadow correction:\n
;ld_indexable(texture2d)(float,float,float,float) ${stereo}.xyzw, l(0, 0, 0, 0), t125.xyzw\n
;add ${tmp1}.x, ${pos_z}.${swizzle_z}, -${stereo}.y\n
;mad ${pos_x}.${swizzle_x}, -${tmp1}.x, ${stereo}.x, ${pos_x}.${swizzle_x}\n
;\n
;${0}
;
;
; The final section allows you to insert new declarations into the shader, and
; 3DMigoto will check that this declaration has not already been inserted
; first. Typically this is used to get access to StereoParams in t125:
;
;[ShaderRegex1.InsertDeclarations]
;dcl_resource_texture2d (float,float,float,float) t125

; texture / render target manipulations
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; NOTE: If you are trying to match a texture the same size as the resolution (or
; a /2, x2, x4 or x8 multiple), you should confirm that the same hash is used
; on different resolutions, and adjust get_resolution_from if necessary.
;
; NOTE: If you find a texture hash seems to change inconsistently, try enabling
; track_texture_updates in the [Rendering] section.

; Updates the game's driver profile on launch.
;
; Any changes here will require the user to OK a UAC prompt the first time they

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Profile]
; This setting should always be added to a profile - it is required for a
; number of other settings to work, as well as allowing the convergence to be
; saved. If you are customising a profile you should **always uncomment this**:
;StereoProfile = 1
;
; This setting enables stereo compute shaders (0x00004000), which is required
; to fix a lot of "one eye" type rendering issues in many DX11 games, and
; allows stereo2mono and the side-by-side / top-and-bottom output modes to work
; in SLI (0x00000008):
;StereoFlagsDX10 = 0x00004008
;
; This sets the default convergence in the profile. Note that 3DMigoto will
; happily override the default value from the driver, but will only override
; the user's custom convergence if it has another reason to update the profile,
; such as a change to another setting (adding a version tag to the Comments
; setting would be one way to force an update):
;StereoConvergence = 0.5
;
; This changes the green text that the driver displays, and is a good place to
; put any reminders to display to the user or just take some credit:
;Comments = "Such and such 3D fix by an awesome modder. Disable motion blur!"
;
; Change the rating: "0": 3D Vision Ready, "1": Excellent, "2": Good,
;                    "3": Fair, "4": Not Recommended
;Compat = "0"
;
; If you have added some comments, you probably want to force the green text to
; show up when the game is next run. Note that like convergence, 3DMigoto will
; only override a user setting here if something else has also been updated
; (such as Comments), so this will usually only show up the first time a user
; runs the game after installing the fix (be sure to enable StereoProfile).
;StereoMemoEnabled = 1
;
; Disable compatibility mode to make sure users are seeing the real deal. Like
; convergence, 3DMigoto will respect the users custom settings here:
;Disable2DD = 1
;
; Put a reminder in the green text of compatibility mode that they are not
; seeing the real deal:
;2DD_Notes = "Compatibility mode is enabled. To use the fix, please disable it with Ctrl+Alt+F11"
;
; These two options change which constant buffers the driver uses to pass the
; separation and convergence to any Vertex and Domain shaders it has modified.
; The default value is 12, and you may need to change it if the game already
; uses that constant buffer for any purpose, which should be apparent as you
; will see 2D geometry on any shader that uses this. You should avoid using
; these constant buffers yourself unless you understand the nuances involved.
;DX10VSCBNumber = 12
;DX10DSCBNumber = 12
;
; If a setting doesn't have a name or you don't know what it is (check the
; d3d11_log.txt for the names of all settings in this profile), you can use the
; hex ID (in fact, you can even paste a complete profile from Geforce Profile
; Manager - just be sure to delete any corrupt string settings if you do):
;0x1033cec2 = 0x00000002
;
; There are many more options, and we have tried to document them here -
; *please* edit this page if you figure out anything new:
