;
; Four types are supported - by default the bindings will simply load the
; configured settings, but type=hold can be specified to have a preset
; active while the button is held, type=toggle can be used to make a simple
; on/off toggle, and type=cycle can be used to cycle between several presets.
;
; Delays (type=hold only) and linear or cosine trasition periods (any key type)
; can be used to better synchonrise setting changes to the game's animations,
; or to smoothly adjust UI elements over a short period of time.
;
; Key bindings: For A-Z and 0-9 on the number row, just use that single
; character. For everything else (including mouse buttons), use the virtual key
; name (with or without the VK_ prefix) or hex code from this article:
; http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx
;

;   XB_A, XB_B, XB_X, XB_Y, XB_START, XB_BACK, XB_GUIDE
; By default all attached controllers are used - to associate a binding with a

; Updates the game's driver profile on launch.
;
; Any changes here will require the user to OK a UAC prompt the first time they
; run the game, but the DLL tries to only do that if it is actually required.
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Profile]
; This setting should always be added to a profile - it is required for a
; number of other settings to work, as well as allowing the convergence to be
; saved. If you are customising a profile you should **always uncomment this**:
;StereoProfile = 1
;
; This setting enables stereo compute shaders, which is requires to fix a lot
; of "one eye" type rendering issues in many DX11 games:
;StereoFlagsDX10 = 0x00004000
;
; This sets the default convergence in the profile. Note that 3DMigoto will
; happily override the default value from the driver, but will only override
; the user's custom convergence if it has another reason to update the profile,
; such as a change to another setting (adding a version tag to the Comments
; setting would be one way to force an update):
;StereoConvergence = 0.5
;
; This changes the green text that the driver displays, and is a good place to
; put any reminders to display to the user or just take some credit:
;Comments = "Such and such 3D fix by an awesome modder. Disable motion blur!"
;
; If you have added some comments, you probably want to force the green text to
; show up when the game is next run. Note that like convergence, 3DMigoto will
; only override a user setting here if something else has also been updated
; (such as Comments), so this will usually only show up the first time a user
; runs the game after installing the fix (be sure to enable StereoProfile).
;StereoMemoEnabled = 1
;
; Disable compatibility mode to make sure users are seeing the real deal. Like
; convergence, 3DMigoto will respect the users custom settings here:
;Disable2DD = 1
;
; Put a reminder in the green text of compatibility mode that they are not
; seeing the real deal:
;2DD_Notes = "Compatibility mode is enabled. To use the fix, please disable it with Ctrl+Alt+F11"
;
; If a setting doesn't have a name or you don't know what it is (check the
; d3d11_log.txt for the names of all settings in this profile), you can use the
; hex ID (in fact, you can even paste a complete profile from Geforce Profile
; Manager - just be sure to delete any corrupt string settings if you do):
;0x1033cec2 = 0x00000002
;
; There are many more options, and we have tried to document them here -
; *please* edit this page if you figure out anything new:

; The following custom shader can convert 3D Vision to Side-by-Side and
; Top-and-Bottom for use with 3D TVs & projectors - to enable this uncomment
; the 'run = CustomShader3DVision2SBS' in the [Present] section, set 3D Vision
; to output "checkerboard" in the control panel (which will remove the 720p
; limitation) and enable this either via the F11 key, or by setting a default
; for x7 in the [Constants] section.
[Resource3DVision2SBSBackupTexture]
[CustomShader3DVision2SBS]
; Load a custom vertex + pixel shader:

; Explicitly unbind other shader types for safety:
hs = null
ds = null

; Disable the OM blend stage that could interfere with the shader:
blend = disable
; Disable front/back face culling so the vertices can be in any rotation:
cull = none
; Use a triangle strip topology so we only have to output four vertices:

; Clear all render + depth targets to avoid compatibility issues:
o1 = null
o2 = null
o3 = null
o4 = null
o5 = null
o6 = null
o7 = null
oD = null
; Bind the back buffer as a render target. set_viewport ensures that the view
; port is the size of the buffer so the draw call will work, and no_view_cache
; is necessary for a few games like Mad Max:
o0 = set_viewport no_view_cache bb
; Back up any textures that were in the ps-t100 slot. The CustomResource
; section will already back up a lot of state, including shaders, render
; targets, depth targets, UAVs, viewports, blend state, rasterizer state,
; primitive topology, etc. but it does not back up textures:
Resource3DVision2SBSBackupTexture = reference ps-t100
; Use the reverse stereo blit to give the shader access to the back buffers of
; both eyes:
ps-t100 = stereo2mono bb
; Some rare games (e.g. Onechanbara Z2) use MSAA back buffers, which cannot be
; directly used with the reverse stereo blit and must be resolved to non MSAA
; versions first. The symptoms will be a black screen after enabling this
; shader with F11. In that case, replace the above line with these two:
; ps-t100 = resolve_msaa bb
; ps-t100 = stereo2mono ps-t100
; Some games such as The Evil Within and Akiba's Trip constantly unbind
; StereoParams & IniParams, so we may need to explicitly rebind them now:

ps-t125 = StereoParams
vs-t120 = IniParams
ps-t120 = IniParams

; full screen using the SV_VertexID semantic so we don't need vertex buffers:
