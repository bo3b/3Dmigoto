;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Custom settings override for any of [convergence, separation, x, y, z, w]
;
; Four types are supported - by default the bindings will simply load the
; configured settings, but type=hold can be specified to have a preset
; active while the button is held, type=toggle can be used to make a simple
; on/off toggle, and type=cycle can be used to cycle between several presets.
;
; Delays (type=hold only) and linear or cosine trasition periods (any key type)
; can be used to better synchonrise setting changes to the game's animations,
; or to smoothly adjust UI elements over a short period of time.
;
; Key bindings: For A-Z and 0-9 on the number row, just use that single
; character. For everything else (including mouse buttons), use the virtual key
; name (with or without the VK_ prefix) or hex code from this article:
; http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx
;
; Keys can also be from XBox controllers using:
;   XB_LEFT_TRIGGER, XB_RIGHT_TRIGGER,
;   XB_LEFT_SHOULDER, XB_RIGHT_SHOULDER,
;   XB_LEFT_THUMB, XB_RIGHT_THUMB,
;   XB_DPAD_UP, XB_DPAD_DOWN, XB_DPAD_LEFT, XB_DPAD_RIGHT,
;   XB_A, XB_B, XB_X, XB_Y, XB_START, XB_BACK, XB_GUIDE
; By default all attached controllers are used - to associate a binding with a
; specific controller add the controller number 1-4 to the prefix, like
; XB2_LEFT_TRIGGER, though this may be more useful for hunting than playing.

;      dump_rt: Dumps render targets as JPS files when possible, or DDS when not.
;     clear_rt: Clears each render target the first time they are used in the
;               frame. Makes it easier to see what is being drawn if the game
;               doesn't clear them, but might cause some effects not to render.

;         mono: Dump out mono textures instead of stereo. To dump both, specify
;               'mono stereo'. If neither are specified, defaults to stereo.
